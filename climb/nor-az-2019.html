<b> Abstract: </b>
I flew down to Arizona for a big computer science conference. The weekend before
and after I climbed in Northern Arizona with some friends-of-friends and random
people I met. I climbed at Winslow Wall (a cool flooded slot canyon with
varnished black sandstone reminiscent of Red Rocks), Priest Draw (a limestone
bouldering area world famous for its pockets and burley climbing on horizontal
roofs), and Paradise Forks (a very traditional and scenic basalt crack climbing
area full of technical stemming and jamming, also popular for highlining).

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
While academia can be demanding, it can also present unique opportunities for
travel. I once met a Slovenian mechanical engineering professor traveling to The
States for a conference. He was strong and psyched, and we had a blast climbing
in the Red River Gorge. After meeting him, I knew I wanted to link work and
climbing trips whenever possible.

<img class="sidebar" src="nor-az-2019/S6iW9Kw.png" alt=" " width="300"/>
<p>
The biggest conference in my field is called Economics and Computation, EC. The
EC community studies computation problems where incentives come into play,
covering diverse topics from voting theory to auction design and interesting
applications from K-12 school choice to resident-hospital matching. It's held
every summer and this year the venue was Phoenix, Arizona. I could describe what
Phoenix is like in June, but I think I'll let the Hill Family help me out here.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PYt0SDnrBE"> Link.</a>


<p>
"Surface of the sun" notwithstanding, by driving two hours north of Phoenix you
gain 5000 feet of elevation and enter into an entirely different ecosystem. The
afternoon of Friday, June 21st, I did exactly that. It was incredibly satisfying
watching the temperature display on my rental car slowly dip from 110 to 75 as
the land around me shifted from cactus-spotted desert to grassy plain to dense
ponderosa pine forest. I’d entered the coconino national forest, a varied
landscape surrounding the city of Flagstaff, my “climbing base” for the trip.

<p>
My camping spot for the night was Priest Draw, an incredible limestone
bouldering area you’ll hear about later. I got in with just enough light left to
explore one boulder. I found out later that this boulder is called the “the
brain”, which is an apt name for it’s huge wiggley ridges. Within those ridges
are the most hilariously large jugs I’d ever seen, which made for perfect and
chill circuits to solo around for a few minutes before it started to get dark.

<h2>Day 1: Winslow Wall
  <span class="date">Sunday, June 23</span>
</h2>

<aside class="sidebar">
  <h2>Planning out partners.</h2>

  <p> One of the trickiest parts of climbing in a new area is finding partners. By far
  my favorite way to do it is simply showing up and meeting people. However,
  sometimes it’s tricky to make this work, and in the case of Flagstaff, I knew
  that the climbing is too spread out. In my case, I had a friend
  who lived out there for almost a year, and he put me in touch with Jackson (and
  Alex, who I climbed with later).
  </p>

  <p> Mountain project is another great resource if you have a trip planned out. You
  can look on the area-specific “partners” forum, or use the partner finder, or
  better yet: look through the “high-contributors” to the areas you’re interested
  in, and direct message them reaching out. Explain what you’re looking for and be
  honest about your skill level. Even if they’re too cool to climb with you, they
  probably know someone who would be a good match and would be psyched to show you
  around!
  </p>

</aside>

<p>
Saturday morning I headed to Flagstaff to meet up with a friend-of-a-friend
named Jackson. Jackson was stoked to show me Winslow wall, which he thought was
one of the real gems of the Flagstaff area. Winslow, Arizona (such a fine sight
to see) is a very small town an hour east of Flagstaff. That short drive brings
you out of the mountains and forest and back into arid grassy plains. However,
Jackson assured me as we bumped along backroads surrounded by a completely flat
landscape, we really were headed to an awesome crag with 100 foot tall routes.

<p>
As we pulled into the parking lot, Jackson announced &ldquo;Wow there are some
many cars! I've never seen it this packed&rdquo;.
Want to guess how many cars there were? Three. This highlights my first piece of
evidence that Flagstaff is an incredible cragging city: <strong> the complete
lack of crowds</strong>. 

<p>
Winslow wall is a narrow sandstone canyon carved out by East Clear Creek.
The approach involves a bit of fourth class scrambling and a fixed rappel.
Once you touch down on the canyon floor, you feel like you've entered another
world. Bizarre rock formations line the walls, sandy beaches frame the creek,
and lime green algae gently bobs along in the creek.
I waded shoeless through the water feeling like a kid in a candy store: the
routes looked incredible!

Route Breakdown:
<ul class="route-list">
  <li> 5.11b Melva and 5.11c Aqua-Velva. These routes both tackled incredible
    “scoop” features carved out of the wall. Both involved some technical
    <strong>stemming</strong>, a climbing move defined by pressing outward
    against the inside faces of the scoops. The stem moves variously left me
    doing the splits or doing a dip with nothing but my hands on the rock or
    even <strong>full body stemming</strong>, with both hands on one side of a
    scoop and both feet on another.

      <h2>Arete Laybacking</h2>
      <p>
      An <strong> arete </strong> is a &ldquo;outside corner&rdquo;, like a
      ridge of rock but vertical. <strong> Laybacking </strong> is a move where
      you need to push to the side with your feet to use a handhold (the
      prototypical example is a crack in a corner &mdash; you push against the
      side wall in order to use the crack as a hold). Put the two together and
      you get one of the coolest moves in rock climbing! Arete Laybacking
      requires you to smear your feet on the same edge you are pulling on with
      your hands &mdash; a motion which feels crazy improbable.
      Here a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQVt-EGbiQ"> very cool
      demo</a> on the ultra-classic Alabama boulder problem Mortal Kombat.
    </aside>

    5.12b Slap My Fro. Climbing magazine liked this arete enough to call it
    one of the <a href="https://www.climbing.com/places/americas-100-best-sport-climbing-routes/">
    100 best sport climbs in America</a>. Now I’m not sure if it quite stacks up
    against, you know, a randomly chosen semi-popular route in the Red River
    Gorge, but it was definitely the highlight of my day! I tried to onsight,
    flailed, did the cruxes a couple times each while hanging around, then I sent!
    Stoke was high.


    <p>
    Some thin moves in the start bring you to the corner rest in the bottom of
    the picture. Next some mellow but very cool arete laybacking brings you to
    the back-to-back cruxes at about two thirds hight, where the angle kicks
    back. The first crux requires flipping a hold to an undercling off bad feet,
    and keeping enough tension to readjust and make a big reach. Jackson gave me
    very helpful beta here. I did the second crux in a very unique way: a
    dyno-to-mantle! Your right hand is on a big slopey ledge for this move, and
    you left hand has some high opposition, so I simply jumped my weight on top
    of my right hand.

    <p>
    Second photo below (not mine &mdash; shot by some guy Damon Vaughan)
    shows the first crux really well. Check out the
    <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106186632/slap-my-fro">

  </li>

  <li> 5.11c The Winsloner. More thin crimping! This felt like a bit of a
    journey, as you weave back and forth following the bolts and the holds.
    There was a very cool &ldquo;upward press&rdquo; move under the mini-roof which felt
    like a competition problem. I had to press upward on nothing to maintain
    balance and walk my feet up.
    I REALLY want to come back for the sweet splitter offwidth to the right of
    this climb. <strong> Offwidths </strong> are cracks wider than a hand or a
    fist which require shoving larger body parts into the crack and slowly
    slithering up. I'm far from an offwidth aficionado, but they can sometimes
    be really fun and often look super inspiring/intimidating.

      <blockquote>
        I think all climbers peak on those desperate, skin-of-the-teeth 5.9
        trad onsights. Cruxing, scared out of your mind, cranking down on your arm like a wrench
        you don't care about. The rest of our climbing careers are spent
        chasing that high.
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>&mdash; Jackson, referencing Stick It 5.10 </strong>
      <p> Jackson commented that I made the 5.10 hand crack look a lot harder
      than the 5.12 arete! He then mentioned that the first time he climbed
      Stick It was a real epic, then casually said the profound quote above.
      &ldquo;Epic&rdquo;ing / flailing on a climb is something you never plan
      for, but something that always teaches you a lot about life and about
      yourself.
    </aside>
    5.10 Stick It. This ended up being the only crack we climbed at Winslow
    Wall. Despite often feeling very comfortable on 5.10 crack climbing, this
    climb felt very physical and hard to me. It was mostly wide hand jams and
    fist jams, which felt very tiring. I resorted to a lot of back scumming,
    stemming, and grunting. I think Jackson found this a little funny after
    how much I'd been spraying about loving Indian Creek and 5.11 finger
    cracks/offwidths.
    He pointed out I'd recaptured a lot of the magic of starting out crack
    climbing, though!

  <li> 5.11d Has Bro. Another awesome arete, this one much more
    &ldquo;blunt&rdquo;/rounded. I didn't get the send on this one &mdash;
    I got super pumped actually fell out of a hand jam at the very top.
    The arete climbing here was very different but equally fun. It felt very
    sequential and there was a lot of switching from one side of the arete to
    the other.

  <li> 5.12c Atlas Shrugged. This route climbs up the steep, dark shield of rock
    in the photo.
    Another party had draws handing on this thin
    crimping testpiece, so I got to try it without worrying about
    hanging/leaving draws up! I wasn't even trying to send,
    but it was cool to try the cruxes. Hopefully I'll come back some day (a
    little less tired!).

  <h2>Spontaneously meeting partners.</h2>

  <p> When you're on a time budget, an effective way to find climbing for a day
  is to just show up in the parking lot and find people who are already planning
  on climbing. It takes a lot of self-confidence, and can sound a little
  ridiculous, but it's actually a super common occurance.
  <a href="https://www.climbing.com/skills/how-to-find-climbing-partners-at-the-crag/">
  Here's </a> a Climbing.com list of tips/tricks.
  It really helps if you're experienced, psyched, and open-minded (after all,
  you're asking that the group be open to climbing with you!).
  When roped climbing, it might be best to meet people in the parking lot
  &mdash; gauge whether you'll climb well together and whether they'd be psyched
  to have you along.
  At Priest Draw, I walked around until I found a group working a problem in my
  range, and very politely asked if I could join them (my line was &ldquo;I
  don't have much to offer except psych, but I'd love to join!&rdquo;).
  From that point on I just tried to be as nice as possible &mdash;
  spotting a lot, being encouraging, and working through beta with people.
  You should also be sure not to hold up a group/be a burden.
  If you keep all this in mind, you'll make bunches of friends!

</aside>

<p>
Without a partner for Sunday, I headed back to my same camp sight at
Priest Draw and promptly collapsed. I woke up <em>exhausted</em> &mdash; I'd
climbed and crimped way too hard the day before. I had a very high gravity
morning and was very slow to start. I needed some real easy climbs to coax the
life back into me. Luckily, the highball v0s of the &ldquo;Welcome
Boulder&rdquo; (picture above) were just the thing to remind me that I know how
to rock climb.

<p>
Priest Draw is probably the most famous place I climbed in Arizona, and that's
for a good reason. Dead horizontal roof climbing is a rare and very special
thing. The geological conditions have to be just right for roof climbs &mdash;
good holds at any other angle are completely unusable on roofs. Also, when big
enough holds do form on roofs, they are often too fragile to stay on for long.
Priest draw remedies this problem with <em> pockets</em> &mdash; its horizontal
roofs are littered with huge solid juggy holes to stuff your hands into.
For a fantastic video series showcasing roof climbing around Flagstaff,
see Rooftown 
(volumes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj9fFRatM1E">One</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nWAXMhY-2I">Two</a>, and
<a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/rooftownvolumethree">Three</a>)
directed by Nathaniel Davison and staring the hyper-crusher Matt Gentile.
Volume Two also features canyons similar to Winslow Wall (although I'm not sure
where exactly they are).

<p>
Eventually I made my way into the boulder field proper. I found a crew of strong
Phoenix folks working on a problem in my grade range:
<strong>Move 'N Groove Barby</strong> (v7).
Luckily they were very friendly and showed me the dark arts of limestone roof
climbing.

<p>
The route climbs a very faint spine-like feature out a not-quite-horizontal
roof. The holds are mostly on the sides of the spine, and a lot of them are huge
jug pockets. Some of these pockets are used as <strong>toe cams</strong>, 
which you use by inserting your foot sideways then twisting to stick it in the
pocket. These toe cams were so locker there was no chance of them blowing out
&mdash; after you set them you could really yard on 'em hard without worry.
The toe cams lead you to two slopey holds which you need to compress between.
Then I finished the route up with a core-intensive high heel hook and slapped
right hand to the jugs over the top.
Thankfully there's not a crimp or a small pocket on the whole route:
nothing but juggy or slopey holds and powerful moves.

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMHBcZFphmE">This video</a> is pretty
similar to the beta I used for this climb. I was proud to figure
out a variation to the top moves for myself:
going up with your right hand to the lip of the boulder keeps
you way more balanced and prevents your feet from cutting.
That topout beta was the last piece of the puzzle: combined with the Phoenix
crew's excellent advice, it allowed me to send after a couple hours of work.
I really wish I had a video of myself (#picsordidnthappen) because it's very
hard to tell what's going on from a picture. But anyway, here's my (probably
indecipherable) notes from my climbing journal.

</div>

<p>
A couple people from the Phoenix crew sent Move 'N Groove (or its neighbor,
called Disco Polly) right around the same time I did. They had to head out after
that, so I thanked them for their awesome hospitality and went on my way.

<h3>Exploring at the Anvil Boulders</h3>

  <h2>Bouldering without a pad.</h2>

  <p> Not gonna lie, solo no-pad bouldering is a bad idea.
  I don't do it much, and when I do, it's a very different experience from
  normal bouldering. What's normally about athleticism and pure physical
  challenge become a exercise in appreciating natural beauty, keeping composure,
  and avoiding getting in over your head.
  If you do this, be very careful!

</aside>

<p>
My morning at the Draw was awesome from an &ldquo;athletic&rdquo; point of view.
But I still wanted to do a little exploring before my conference started.
I drove down through Sedona, Arizona &mdash; a popular tourist destination which
<em>looks</em> like it's really good for rock climbing. There tons of exposed
rock everywhere! However, from what I've heard it's mostly very loose, and the
approaches are pretty grueling.
Instead of the long trad climbs, I had my eye set on the Anvil Boulders, a small
cluster just outside town.

<p>
What I found was actually crazy impressive.
The Anvils were a super dense cluster of huge and bullet-hard sandstone
boulders, reminiscent in style and quality of Joe's Valley in Utah.
I soloed around on a few v0-looking climbs whose names I couldn't find,
and marveled at the beautiful crystal and plated and pocketed rock features.
The awesome-looking hard climbs are just one of the many reasons I'll have to
make it back to Arizona some day.

<p>
There was one moderate I really wanted to try: Lazer Cut (v4).
I was lucky enough to find a party working it!
They were the only other people in the boulder field, and were happy to let me
join them for a few minutes. The boulder was awesome fun, and I managed to get
this sweet beta slideshow from one of the guy's laps.

<h2>Interlude: Economics and Computation
</h2>

<p> After the Anvil boulders, I drove down to Phoenix, returned my rental car,
and settled into my AirBnb for the week. The conference was very interesting,
and it was great to meet different people in my field and hear what interested
them.

<p> I was exhausted after a week of the conference, but for some reason, I
thought I should set up a trip back to Winslow Wall for Saturday which would
require me to wake up at 4am, get another rental car, then drive 3 hours.
Thankfully, those plans got cancelled, and I got to sleep in before heading back
to Priest Draw for another day of bouldering.

<p> As far as &ldquo;getting sendy&rdquo; goes, my second weekend was a little
less successful than the first. A Priest Draw, I tried something very very hard
for me, and at Paradise Forks, I thought exploring and mileage were a little
more important. But it was still a stellar weekend!

<h2>Day 3: Priest Draw
  <span class="date">Saturday, June 29</span>
</h2>

<p>
My second day in Priest Draw was actually pretty similar to the first.
Slow to start, but finally got rolling pretty hard. I started on the Welcome
Boulder again, then looked around to see which climbs people were working on. I
did a few moderates with different crews, including The Fin (v1) and The Bat
Cave (v3). The latter problem was spectacular: enormous jugs on a dead
horizontal roof, complete with heel hooks, toe cams, and a
<strong>bat-hang</strong> (hanging by just your toes) for the finish.

<div class="gallery">
  <img src="nor-az-2019/20190629_144306.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<p>
Eventually, I realized I should probably climb with the group of two dudes from
Albuquerque (both incidentally pictured above) who were sitting around chilling
at The Bat Roof. They were waiting for the sun to go down and things to get
cooler to try Carnivore Direct, v9. While I'd never done a v9, I was really
psyched to try!

<p>
Anyway, I didn't send. But here's a mega edited 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXr3fpBTais">video</a> of me doing the
moves #fake #picsanddidnthappen.



<h2>Day 4: Paradise Forks
  <span class="date">Sunday, June 30</span>
</h2>

<aside class="sidebar">
  <h2>&ldquo;Going ground up&rdquo;.</h2>

  <p>
  Discussions of climbing ethics are really interesting and really
  nuanced. One modern phenomenon: it seems to matter less these days how you
  work a climb, so long as you &ldquo;really send&rdquo; when it's sending
  time. Back in the day this wasn't always the case. One key example: 
  you &ldquo;weren't allowed to&rdquo;
  <strong>hangdog</strong> (sit hanging on your rope to try the moves again),
  you were always lowered to the ground when you fell.
  While hangdogging is no longer frowned upon, the importance of
  <strong>going ground up</strong> (i.e. not feeling holds on rappel or
  working moves on toprope) is still up for debate.

  <p>
  This very discussion is super relevant to Paradise Forks, an area where
  topropes are incredibly convenient because you hike in to the top of the
  cliffs. Paul Davidson, who established many of the routes at The Forks (the
  hardest crack I climbed here, as well as the entire wall I climbed on Monday
  are named for him) has this to say (
  <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105787813/paradise-forks">
  source</a>):
  <blockquote>
    Most folks want to do more faster. My experience though tells me that I'm
    much more satisfied with finally getting a difficult ground up lead (which
    would usually grind me up and spit me out) than something done in a short
    cutting fashion. I just do not get the same feeling of accomplishment by
    wiring something out on TR and then leading it.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
  Mikey Schaefer (epic climber and modern Yosemite hardman) has something
  slightly strong to say (admittedly, he's talking about a 20 pitch Yosemite
  bigwall free climb, so the context is a bit different)
  (<a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/109275454/father-time">source</a>):
  <blockquote>
    Whatever you do resist the urge to hike up [...] and rappel into
    work on the crux pitches. This shouldn't be treated as sport climb like El
    Cap is these days. If I could manage to get the rope up there all by
    myself, hand drilling bolts from stances, a repeat ascent should be able
    to start at the ground and go to the top. 
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  Mikey and Paul's values come from a tremendous amount of pride which they
  deservingly feel for their climbing style. They are right: going ground up
  increases the difficulty and sense of adventure tremendously.
  Toproping a climb first is a decrease in style, possibly comparable to
  <strong>pinkpointing</strong> (fixing pieces of trad gear beforehand 
  so you don't have to place them while you're climbing).

  <p> But am I, a modern climber raised in a gym and stoked on performance,
  going to stop toproping trad climbs? No.
  Is there heresy? Maybe. But it certainly seems to be where climbing is headed
  these days. The lines are simply too blury. Is hanging every other move much
  different than toproping? What if I aid (pull on pieces) to the top 
  then give it a run on toprope? <!-- And don't even get me started on all the other
  things that could be considered cheating (modern trad gear, watching beta
  videos, even kneebar pads). -->

  <p>
  I don't have a clean answer for what's right and wrong in climbing, any more
  than I do for life in general.
  Here's something I do know: when I try to onsight at my limit,
  I feel every ounce of adventure of going ground up.
  Maybe I redpoint in a different way than old-schoolers going ground up.
  But onsighting still feels the same.

Sunday morning, I met up with Alex, a different friend-of-a-friend who live is
Flagstaff. We were planning to climb at Paradise Forks, a basalt crack climbing
area. We'd mostly be trad climbing (placing out own pieces of protection as we
went, as opposed to sport climbing, where there are bolts pre-placed for
protection). I'd never climbed on basalt before, so I was eager to check it out.

<p>
Alex works at a bar, so he needed to get a somewhat late start. That was fine by
me after I'd climbed myself half to death the weekend before.
We rolled out around 11, and after the 40 minute drive, quickly got to the top
of the cliffs. At this area, you approach from the top, so you have to rappel in
and then climb back out. We set up a single rappel station for the day.

<p> Route breakdown:

<ul class="route-list">
  <li> 5.9 Pillow Talk. Sinker hand jams! After getting worked on a hand crack
    the weekend before, it was comforting that this route wasn't much trouble.
    There's a few nice hand cracks in the picture below, but Pillow Talk is the
    prominent <strong>splitter</strong> (i.e. a crack through a level face 
    &mdash; not in a corner) on the farthest jutting-out section of rock.

  <li>
    5.11+ Davidson Dihedral. This ended up being my hardest crack climb in
    Northern Arizona. It's immediately to the left of Pillow Talk, so I set a
    single anchor we could use for both climbs. I started with a lap on toprope.
    I tried the moves and worked the gear placements,
    and memorized as much as possible. Alex took a run on toprope while I
    nervously tried to run though the hard sections and the trickiest
    placements.

    <p> The route starts with a few technical face moves, then a long series of
    strenuous but straightforward finger locks.
    The crux for me was a long reach off of a very interesting undercling
    jam/downpulling crimp hold. The reach bypasses a crazy thin section and gets
    you to a good finger lock. Moving feet up below and then through the thin
    section is a little trick as well, but then you're home free, with great
    locks, hand jams, and secure trad placements to the top.
    I was stoked to successfully send!

    5.11a The Prow. The climb features one of my most dreaded crack sizes:
    <strong>finger stacks</strong> (aka ring locks). When a crack is too wide
    for fingers, but too small for hands, you have no choice but to ring lock
    (well, you could go climb something else... but I digress). The basic
    strategy is to lay your thumb along one side of the crack, then
    fingers over your thumb to make them wide enough. Yep. Good luck making that
    work.

    <p> Despite my fear of ring locks, I managed to send without too much fuss.
    Lots of stemming and face climbing was involved.
    The position on the route was really rad &mdash; it's right at the nape of
    the &ldquo;fork&rdquo; which paradise forks is named after. Photo by JMo from

    5.12b Americans at Arapiles. When I said The Prow was at the exact name of
    the &ldquo;fork&rdquo; of the forks, I lied. <em>This</em> sport climb, just
    to the right of The Prow, is the true &ldquo;prow&rdquo; of the Forks.
    It's very existence is controversial, as The Forks is mostly a trad climbing
    area. But I've already put a length discussion of climbing ethics in one
    sidebar, so I won't get into all that today. I'll say this &mdash; I thought
    this climb was super rad.

    <p> Like before, I made one anchor which I could use to belay Alex up the
    prow and which I could use to try Americans at Arapiles. The climb starts at
    a ledge halfway up the cliff so that was actually one of the easiest ways to
    get to it. I DID NOT feel confident standing at the base &mdash; the crux
    move at the second bolt (more arete laybacking!) is super hard and super
    technical, and I could only barely sorta do it on toprope.
    After having a bit of trouble reaching the second bolt, I faced
    down the crux and managed to get really psyched and try really hard.
    Before I knew it I was staring down the third bolt! Amazing!
    It was a tricky, balancy clip, but I made it and leaned over to grab at the
    next holds. I made the next foot adjustment... and was promptly hanging from
    the rope! Yep, I blew it after the crux. 

    <p> The rest of the climb was tricky, but I'd gotten it pretty much figured
    out on toprope, and I zipped right up it. I would've liked to send, but it
    would be really inconvenient to try again, and I was just psyched I'd gotten
    past the crux after feeling like it was impossible.

We were planning to do another route or two, but we got distracted by highlining
(more on that later). That night, we sat around Alex's fire pit with a
couple of his friends &mdash; a super chill night.

<h2>Day 5: Paradise Forks
  <span class="date">Monday, July 1</span>
</h2>

<p>
We were psyched enough on the forks to get right back at it!
Alex had to head to work at 5pm, so again we kinda only got a half day.
All the climbs we did were at the sunny Davidson Wall, so we racked up and got
ready at the top of the climbs. Thus, I didn't ever bring my phone.
Here a picture of the cliff from the other side of the ravine, though!

</div>

<ul>
  <li> <p> 5.10 Queenfolia. This steep and exposed line really woke me up in the
    morning! The crux moves were pretty hard and pumpy, and all of your gear for
    the crux was behind a single massive but thin flake of rock.
    Super cool moves, though!
  </li>
  <li> <p> 5.11c Three Turkeys. This route starts with some technical but easy
    corner climbing, then you run up a pumpy, jagged flake. You make a hard
    transition into a flared hand crack, and climb the crack using face holds.
    The flake transition went well, but the flared jams were really pumping me
    out, and the gear through in the back of the flare was small (though very good).
    I got very pumped and ended up wimping out and yelling take a few jams from
    the top. That was kind of a bummer &mdash; I probably should've gone for it.
  </li>
  <li> <p> 5.10+ Torpedo. This route follows a pair of hand cracks and involved
    lots of stemming. Slightly uneventful, but very fun!
  </li>
  <li> <p> 5.10+ Retard's Recess. Holy cow. I legitimately
    don't think I've even been closer to falling (and not!) than on this route.
    The climbing was easy up until a completely baffling crux roof.
    You got an undercling/hand jam with your right hand, but above that the
    crack pinches down to almost nothing. With your left hand you get a sloper,
    then a huge reach to a jug lip. Somehow I desperately full-body
    scummed across the wall below the sloper and worked a manky jam higher and
    higher in the crack. This gave me enough height to thrutch to the lip, not
    knowing how good of a hold was over the top. Thankfully it was a jug! It
    felt good to really go for it after wimping out on Three Turkeys. From there
    to the top was cruzer.

<h3> Highlining </h3>


<p>
<!-- One of my favorite parts of the Forks was getting to highline! -->
One of the first things we saw when we got to the Forks was a highline
stretching across the canyon.
<strong>Highlining</strong> is slacklining, i.e. walking a thin stretchy piece
of webbing, high up in the air (almost always harnessed into the line).
I'd gotten into highlining slowly a couple years ago because a few of my friends
really liked it. I was really stoked to try the line from the minute I saw it,
but the riggers were nowhere in sight, so we went about our day of climbing. 
By the afternoon on Sunday, they highliners had returned, so we introduced
ourselves and tried it out. We ended up each taking a couple sessions after
climbing both days.

<p>
Highlining is a really special thing. Bobbing up and down and watching the
shift between the foreground, midground, and background is really cool.
You can do a lot of easy tricks and spins around the line.
Just like climbing you can always keep pushing yourself to the next goal
(walking father, doing a new trick, or establishing the next coolest line).
In fact, highlining has a following almost as rad as climbing, and It was great
to meet the awesome group of people that put that line up.

<p>
This highline was a good deal shorter than most
I've been on before, and thus a lot easier.
I managed to take 8 steps, way up from my old personal record of 2!
Here's a (regrettably sideways) 
<a href="https://youtu.be/ZDbkNxq4FXk">video</a>
showing what it's like to fall on a highline.
