<b> Abstract: </b>
I flew down to Arizona for a big computer science conference. The weekend before
and after I climbed in Northern Arizona with some friends-of-friends and random
people I met. I climbed at Winslow Wall (a cool flooded slot canyon with
varnished black sandstone reminiscent of Red Rocks), Priest Draw (a limestone
bouldering area world famous for its pockets and burley climbing on horizontal
roofs), and Paradise Forks (a very traditional and scenic basalt crack climbing
area full of technical stemming and jamming, also popular for highlining). 


<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
While academia can be demanding, it can also present unique opportunities for
travel. I once met a Slovenian mechanical engineering professor traveling to The
States for a conference. He was strong and psyched, and we had a blast climbing
in the Red River Gorge. After meeting him, I knew I wanted to link work and
climbing trips whenever possible.

<img class="sidebar" src="nor-az-2019/S6iW9Kw.png" alt=" " width="300"/>
<p>
The biggest conference in my field is called Economics and Computation, EC. The
EC community studies computation problems where incentives come into play,
covering diverse topics from voting theory to auction design and interesting
applications from K-12 school choice to resident-hospital matching. It's held
every summer and this year the venue was Phoenix, Arizona. I could describe what
Phoenix is like in June, but I think I'll let the Hill Family help me out here.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PYt0SDnrBE"> Link.</a>


<p>
"Surface of the sun" notwithstanding, by driving two hours north of Phoenix you
gain 5000 feet of elevation and enter into an entirely different ecosystem. The
afternoon of Friday, June 21st, I did exactly that. It was incredibly satisfying
watching the temperature display on my rental car slowly dip from 110 to 75 as
the land around me shifted from cactus-spotted desert to grassy plain to dense
ponderosa pine forest. I’d entered the coconino national forest, a varied
landscape surrounding the city of Flagstaff, my “climbing base” for the trip.

<p>
My camping spot for the night was Priest Draw, an incredible limestone
bouldering area you’ll hear about later. I got in with just enough light left to
explore one boulder. I found out later that this boulder is called the “the
brain”, which is an apt name for it’s huge wiggley ridges. Within those ridges
are the most hilariously large jugs I’d ever seen, which made for perfect and
chill circuits to solo around for a few minutes before it started to get dark.

<h2>Day 1: Winslow Wall</h2>

<aside class="sidebar">
  <h2>Planning out partners.</h2>

  <p> One of the trickiest parts of climbing in a new area is finding partners. By far
  my favorite way to do it is simply showing up and meeting people. However,
  sometimes it’s tricky to make this work, and in the case of Flagstaff, I knew
  that the climbing is too spread out for this to work. In my case, I had a friend
  who lived out there for almost a year, and he put me in touch with Jackson (and
  Alex, who I climbed with later).
  </p>

  <p> Mountain project is another great resource if you have a trip planned out. You
  can look on the area-specific “partners” forum, or use the partner finder, or
  better yet: look through the “high-contributors” to the areas you’re interested
  in, and direct message them reaching out. Explain what you’re looking for and be
  honest about your skill level. Even if they’re too cool to climb with you, they
  probably know someone who would be a good match and would be psyched to show you
  around!
  </p>

<p>
Saturday morning I headed to Flagstaff to meet up with a friend-of-a-friend
named Jackson. Jackson was stoked to show me Winslow wall, which he thought was
one of the real gems of the Flagstaff area. Winslow, Arizona (such a fine sight
to see) is a very small town an hour east of Flagstaff. That short drive brings
you out of the mountains and forest and back into arid grassy plains. However,
Jackson assured me as we bumped along backroads surrounded by a completely flat
landscape, we really were headed to an awesome crag with 100 foot tall routes.

<p>
Winslow wall is a narrow sandstone canyon carved out by East Clear Creek.  

<p>
Routes Breakdown:
<ul>
  <li> 5.11b Mulva and 5.11c Aqua-Vulva. These routes both tackled incredible
    “scoop” features carved out of the wall.

    </div>
  </li>
  <li> 5.12b Slap My Fro. Climbing magazine liked this arete enough to call it
    one of the <a href="https://www.climbing.com/places/americas-100-best-sport-climbing-routes/">
    100 best sport climbs in America</a>. Now I’m not sure if it quite stacks up
    against, you know, a randomly chosen semi-popular route in the Red River
    Gorge, but it was definitely the highlight of my day! I tried to onsight,
    flailed, did the cruxes a couple times each while hangdogging, then I sent!
    Stoke was high.

    <p>
    Some thin moves in the start bring you to the corner rest in the bottom of
    the picture. Next some mellow but very cool arete laybacking brings you to
    the back-to-back cruxes at about two thirds hight, where the angle kicks
    back. The first crux requires flipping a hold to an undercling off bad feet,
    and keeping enough tension to readjust and make a big reach. Jackson gave me
    very helpful beta here. I did the second crux in a very unique way: a
    dyno-to-mantle! Your right hand is on a big slopey ledge for this move, and
    you left hand has some high opposition, so I simply jumped my weight on top
    of my right hand.

    <p>
    Second photo below (not mine &mdash; shot by some guy Damon Vaughan)
    shows the first crux really well. Check out the
    <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106186632/slap-my-fro">

  <li> 5.11c The Winsloner. More thin crimping! This felt like a bit of a
    journey, as you weave back and forth following the bolts and the holds.
    There was a very cool "upward press" move under the mini-roof which felt
    like a competition problem. I had to press upward on nothing to maintain
    balance and walk my feet up.

    <blockquote>
      I think all climbers peak on those desperate, skin-of-the-teeth 5.9
      trad onsights. Cruxing, scared, cranking down on your arm like a wrench
      you don't care about. We keep climbing just to chase that high.

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>Any plain, lowercase word is a variable in ruby. Variables may consist of
letters, digits and underscores.</p>

<p><code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>banana2</code> or <code>phone_a_quail</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Variables are like nicknames. Remember when everyone used to call you Stinky
Pete? People would say, “Get over here, Stinky Pete!” And everyone miraculously
knew that Stinky Pete was you.</p>

<p>With variables, you give a nickname to something you use frequently. For
instance, let’s say you run an orphanage. It’s a mean orphanage. And whenever
Daddy Warbucks comes to buy more kids, we insist that he pay us <strong>one-hundred
twenty-one dollars and eight cents</strong> for the kid’s teddy bear, which the kid has
become attached to over in the darker moments of living in such nightmarish
custody.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">teddy_bear_fee</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">121.08</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Later, when you ring him up at the cash register (a really souped-up cash
register which runs Ruby!), you’ll need to add together all his charges into a
<strong>total</strong>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">orphan_fee</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">teddy_bear_fee</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">gratuity</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Those variable nicknames sure help. And in the seedy underground of child sales,
any help is appreciated I’m sure.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4a.png" alt="They mock my examples." title="They mock my examples." /></p>

<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>The most basic type of number is an <em>integer</em>, a <strong>series of digits</strong> which can
start with a <strong>plus or minus sign</strong>.</p>

<p><code>1</code>, <code>23</code>, and <code>-10000</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Commas are not allowed in numbers, but underscores are. So if you feel the need
to mark your thousands so the numbers are more readable, use an underscore.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">population</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12_000_000_000</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Decimal numbers are called <em>floats</em> in Ruby. Floats consist of numbers with <strong>a
decimal place</strong> or <strong>scientific notation</strong>.</p>

<p><code>3.14</code>, <code>-808.08</code> and <code>12.043e-04</code> are examples.</p>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>Strings are any sort of characters (letters, digits, punctuation) surrounded by
quotes. Both single and double <strong>quotes</strong> are used to create strings.</p>

<p><code>"sealab"</code>, <code>'2021'</code>, or <code>"These cartoons are hilarious!"</code> are examples.</p>

<p>When you enclose characters in quotes, they are stored together as a single
string.</p>

<p>Think of a reporter who is jotting down the mouth noises of a rambling celebrity.
“I’m a lot wiser,” says Avril Lavigne. “Now I know what the business is
like—what you have to do and how to work it.”</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">avril_quote</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"I'm a lot wiser.  Now I know
what the business is like -- what you have
to do and how to work it."</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, just as we stored a number in the <strong>teddy_bear_fee</strong> variable, now we’re
storing a collection of characters (a string) in the <strong>avril_quote</strong> variable.
The reporter sends this quote to the printers, who just happen to use Ruby to
operate their printing press.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">oprah_quote</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">avril_quote</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">ashlee_simpson_debacle</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4b.png" alt="They desire to be in my examples." title="They desire to
be in my examples." /></p>

<h3>Symbols</h3>

<p>Symbols are words that look just like variables. Again, they may contain
letters, digits, or underscores. But they <strong>start with a colon</strong>.</p>

<p><code>:a</code>, <code>:b</code>, or <code>:ponce_de_leon</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Symbols are lightweight strings. Usually, symbols are used in situations where
you need a string but you won’t be printing it to the screen.</p>

<p>You could say a symbol is a bit easier on the computer. It’s like an antacid.
The colon indicates the bubbles trickling up from your computer’s stomach as it
digests the symbol. Ah. Sweet, sweet relief.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4c.png" alt="Chunky bacon!!" title="Chunky bacon!!" /></p>

<h3>Constants</h3>

<p>Constants are words like variables, but constants are <strong>capitalized</strong>. If
variables are the nouns of Ruby, then think of constants as the proper nouns.</p>

<p><code>Time</code>, <code>Array</code> or <code>Bunny_Lake_is_Missing</code> are examples.</p>

<p>In English, proper nouns are capitalized. The Empire State Building. You can’t
just move The Empire State Building. You can’t just decide that the Empire State
Building is something else. Proper nouns are like that. They refer to something
very specific and usually don’t change over time.</p>

<p>In the same way, constants can’t be changed after they are set.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="no">EmpireStateBuilding</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"350 5th Avenue, NYC, NY"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we try to change the constant, Ruby will complain to us. Such things are
frowned upon.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4d.png" alt="Come on, chunky bacon." title="Come on, chunky bacon." /></p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>If variables and constants are the nouns, then methods are the verbs. Methods
are usually attached to the end of variables and constants by a <strong>dot</strong>. You’ve
already seen methods at work.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">open</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above, <strong>open</strong> is the method. It is the action, the verb. In some cases,
you’ll see actions chained together.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">close</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ve instructed the computer to open the front door and then immediately close
it.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">is_open?</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above is an action as well. We’re instructing the computer to test the door
to see if it’s open. The method could be called <code>Door.test_to_see_if_its_open</code>,
but the <code>is_open?</code> name is succinct and just as correct. Both exclamation marks
and question marks may be used in method names.</p>

<h3>Method arguments</h3>

<p>A method may require more information in order to perform its action. If we want
the computer to paint the door, we should provide a color as well.</p>

<p>Method arguments are attached to the end of a method. The arguments are usually
surrounded by <strong>parentheses</strong> and separated by <strong>commas</strong>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">paint</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:red</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above paints the front door 3 coats of red.</p>

<p>Think of it as an inner tube the method is pulling along, containing its extra
instructions. The parentheses form the wet, round edges of the inner tube. The
commas are the feet of each argument, sticking over the edge. The last argument
has its feet tucked under so they don’t show.</p>

<p>Like a boat pulling many inner tubes, methods with arguments can be chained.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">front_door</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">paint</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:red</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">dry</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">30</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">close</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above paints the front door 3 coats of red, dries for 30 minutes, and closes
the door. Even though the last method has no arguments, you can still put
parentheses if you like. There is no use dragging an empty inner tube, so the
parentheses are normally dropped.</p>

<p>Some methods (such as <code>print</code>) are kernel methods. These methods are used
throughout Ruby. Since they are so common, you won’t use the dot.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"See, no dot."</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3>Class methods</h3>

<p>Like the methods described above (also called <em>instance</em> methods), class methods
are usually attached after variables and constants. Rather than a dot, a
<strong>double colon</strong> is used.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="no">Door</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="ss">:oak</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As seen above, the <code>new</code> class method is most often used to create things. In
the above example, we’re asking Ruby to make a new oak door for us. Of course,
Ruby has to have an understanding of how to make a door—as well as a wealth of
timber, lumberjacks, and those long, wiggly, two-man saws.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4e.png" alt="Plenty of chunky bacon to go around." title="Plenty of
chunky bacon to go around." /></p>

<h3>Global variables</h3>

<p>Variables which begin with a <strong>dollar sign</strong> are global.</p>

<p><code>$x</code>, <code>$1</code>, <code>$chunky</code> and <code>$CHunKY_bACOn</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Most variables are rather temporary in nature. Some parts of your program are
like little houses. You walk in and they have their own variables. In one house,
you may have a <code>dad</code> that represents Archie, a traveling salesman and skeleton
collector. In another house, <code>dad</code> could represent Peter, a lion tamer with a
great love for flannel. Each house has its own meaning for <code>dad</code>.</p>

<p>With global variables, you can be guaranteed that the variable is the same in
every little house. The dollar sign is very appropriate. Every American home
respects the value of the dollar. We’re crazy for the stuff. Try knocking on any
door in America and hand them cash. I can guarantee you won’t get the same
reaction if you knock on a door and offer Peter, a lion tamer with a great love
for flannel.</p>

<p>Global variables can be used anywhere in your program. They never go out of
sight.</p>

<h3>Instance variables</h3>

<p>Variables which begin with an <strong>at</strong> symbol are instance variables.</p>

<p><code>@x</code>, <code>@y</code>, and <code>@only_the_chunkiest_cut_of_bacon_I_have_ever_seen</code> are
examples.</p>

<p>These variables are often used to define the attributes of something. For
example, you might provide Ruby with the width of the <code>front_door</code> by setting
the <code>@width</code> variable inside that <code>front_door</code>. Instance variables are used to
define characteristics of a single object in Ruby.</p>

<p>Think of the <strong>at</strong> symbol as meaning <strong>attribute</strong>.</p>

<h3>Class variables</h3>

<p>Variables which begin with <strong>double at</strong> symbols are class variables.</p>

<p><code>@@x</code>, <code>@@y</code>, and <code>@@i_will_take_your_chunky_bacon_and_raise_you_two</code> are
examples.</p>

<p>Class variables, too, are used to define attributes. But rather than defining an
attribute for a single object in Ruby, class variables give an attribute to many
related objects in Ruby. If instance variables set attributes for a single
<code>front_door</code>, then class variables set attributes for everything that is a
<code>Door</code>.</p>

<p>Think of the <strong>double at</strong> prefix as meaning <strong>attribute all</strong>. Additionally,
you can think of a swarm of <strong>AT-ATs</strong> from <em>Star Wars</em>, which are all commanded
by Ruby. You change a class variable and not just one changes, they all change.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4f.png" alt="Woohoo! Chunky bacon accomplished!" title="Woohoo! Chunky
bacon accomplished!" /></p>

<h3>Blocks</h3>

<p>Any code surrounded by <strong>curly braces</strong> is a block.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">times</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Yes, I've used chunky bacon in my examples, but never again!"</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With blocks, you can group a set of instructions together so that they can be
passed around your program. The curly braces give the appearance of crab pincers
that have snatched the code and are holding it together. When you see these two
pincers, remember that the code inside has been pressed into a single unit.</p>

<p>It’s like one of those little Hello Kitty boxes they sell at the mall that’s
stuffed with tiny pencils and microscopic paper, all crammed into a glittery
transparent case that can be concealed in your palm for covert stationery
operations. Except that blocks don’t require so much squinting.</p>

<p>The curly braces can also be traded for the words <strong>do</strong> and <strong>end</strong>, which is
nice if your block is longer than one line.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="kp">loop</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Much better."</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Ah.  More space!"</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"My back was killin' me in those crab pincers."</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3>Block arguments</h3>

<p>Block arguments are a set of variables surrounded by <strong>pipe</strong> characters and
separated by <strong>commas</strong>.</p>

<p><code>|x|</code>, <code>|x,y|</code>, and <code>|up, down, all_around|</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Block arguments are used at the beginning of a block.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above example, <code>|x,y|</code> are the arguments. After the arguments, we have a
bit of code. The expression <code>x + y</code> adds the two arguments together.</p>

<p>I like to think of the pipe characters as representing a tunnel. They give the
appearance of a chute that the variables are sliding down. (An <code>x</code> goes down
spread eagle, while the <code>y</code> neatly crosses her legs.) This chute acts as a
passageway between blocks and the world around them.</p>

<p>Variables are passed through this chute (or tunnel) into the block.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-4g.png" alt="And then, the dismal truth." title="And then, the dismal
truth." /></p>

<h3>Ranges</h3>

<p>A range is two values surrounded by <strong>parentheses</strong> and separated by <strong>an
ellipsis</strong> (in the form of two or three dots).</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(1..3)</code> is a range, representing the numbers 1 through 3.</li>
  <li><code>('a'..'z')</code> is a range, representing a lowercase alphabet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of it as an accordion which has been squeezed down for carrying. (Sure,
you can build a great sense of self-worth by carrying around an unfolded
accordion, but sometimes a person needs to wallow in self-doubt, carefully
concealing the squeeze-box.) The parentheses are the handles on the sides of a
smaller, handheld accordion. The dots are the chain, keeping the folds tightly
closed.</p>

<p>Normally, only two dots are used. If a third dot is used, the last value in the
range is excluded.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(0...5)</code> represents the numbers 0 through 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you see that third dot, imagine opening the accordion slightly. Just enough
to let one note from its chamber. The note is that end value. We’ll let the sky
eat it.</p>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>An array is a list surrounded by <strong>square brackets</strong> and separated by
<strong>commas</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>[1, 2, 3]</code> is an array of numbers.</li>
  <li><code>['coat', 'mittens', 'snowboard']</code> is an array of strings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of it as a caterpillar which has been stapled into your code. The two
square brackets are staples which keep the caterpillar from moving, so you can
keep track of which end is the head and which is the tail. The commas are the
caterpillar’s legs, wiggling between each section of its body.</p>

<p>Once there was a caterpillar who had commas for legs. Which meant he had to
allow a literary pause after each step. The other caterpillars really respected
him for it and he came to have quite a commanding presence. Oh, and talk about a
philanthropist! He was notorious for giving fresh leaves to those
less-fortunate.</p>

<p>Yes, an array is a collection of things, but it also keeps those things in a
specific order.</p>

<h3>Hashes</h3>

<p>A hash is a dictionary surrounded by <strong>curly braces</strong>. Dictionaries match words
with their definitions. Ruby does so with <strong>arrows</strong> made from an equals sign,
followed by a greater-than sign.</p>

<p><code>{'a' =&gt; 'aardvark', 'b' =&gt; 'badger'}</code> is an example.</p>

<p>This time, the curly braces represent little book symbols. See how they look
like little, open books with creases down the middle? They represent opening and
closing our dictionary.</p>

<p>Imagine our dictionary has a definition on each of its pages. The commas
represent the corner of each page, which we turn to see the next definition. And
on each page: a word followed by an arrow pointing to the definition.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="p">{</span> <span class="s1">'name'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'Peter'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'profession'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'lion tamer'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'great love'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'flannel'</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’m not comparing hashes to dictionaries because you can only store definitions
in a hash. In the example above, I stored personal information for Peter, the
lion tamer with a great love for flannel. Hashes are like dictionaries because
they can be very easy to search through.</p>

<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>A regular expression (or <em>regexp</em>) is a set of characters surrounded by
<strong>slashes</strong>.</p>

<p><code>/ruby/</code>, <code>/[0-9]+/</code> and <code>/^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/</code> are examples.</p>

<p>Regular expressions are used to find words or patterns in text. The slashes on
each side of the expression are pins.</p>

<p>Imagine if you had a little word with pins on both side and you held it over a
book. You pass the word over the book and when it gets near a matching word, it
starts blinking. You pin the regular expression onto the book, right over the
match and it glows with the letters of the matching word.</p>

<p>Oh, and when you poke the pins into the book, the paper sneezes, <em>reg-exp!</em></p>

<p>Regular expressions are much faster than passing your hand over pages of a book.
Ruby can use a regular expression to search volumes of books very quickly.</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>You’ll use the following list of operators to do math in Ruby or to compare
things. Scan over the list, recognize a few. You know, addition <code>+</code> and
subtraction <code>-</code> and so on.</p>

<pre><code>** !  ~  *  /  %  +  -  &amp;
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; |  ^  &gt;  &gt;= &lt;  &lt;= &lt;=&gt;
|| != =~ !~ &amp;&amp; += -= == ===
.. ... not and or
</code></pre>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>Ruby has a number of built-in words, imbued with meaning. These words cannot be
used as variables or changed to suit your purposes. Some of these we’ve already
discussed. They are in the safe house, my friend. You touch these and you’ll be
served an official syntax error.</p>

<pre><code>alias   and     BEGIN   begin   break   case    class   def     defined
do      else    elsif   END     end     ensure  false   for     if
in      module  next    nil     not     or      redo    rescue  retry
return  self    super   then    true    undef   unless  until   when
while   yield
</code></pre>

<p>Good enough. These are the illustrious members of the Ruby language. We’ll be
having quite the junket for the next three chapters, gluing these parts together
into sly bits of (poignant) code.</p>

<p>I’d recommend skimming all of the parts of speech once again. Give yourself a
broad view of them. I’ll be testing your metal in the next section.</p>

  <h2>Seven Moments of Zen from My Life</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>8 years old. Just laying in bed, thinking. And I realize. <em>There’s nothing
stopping me from becoming a child dentist.</em></li>
    <li>21. Found a pencil on the beach. Embossed on it: <em>I cherish serenity.</em> Tucked
it away into the inside breast pocket of my suit jacket. Watched the waves come
and recede.</li>
    <li>22. Found a beetle in my bathroom that was just about to fall into a heating
vent. Swiped him up. Tailored him a little backpack out of a leaf and a thread.
In the backpack: a skittle and a <span class="caps">AAA</span> battery. That
should last him. Set him loose out by the front gate.</li>
    <li>Three years of age. Brushed aside the curtain. Sunlight.</li>
    <li>14. Riding my bike out on the pier with my coach who is jogging behind me as
the sun goes down right after I knocked out Piston Honda in the original
Nintendo version of Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out.</li>
    <li>11. Sick. Watching Heathcliff on television. For hours, it was Heathcliff.
And he was able to come right up close to my face. His head spun toward me. His
face pulsed back and forth, up close, then off millions of miles away. Sound was
gone. In fractions of a second, Heathcliff filled the universe, then blipped off
to the end of infinity. I heard my mother’s voice trying to cut through the
cartoon. Heathclose, Heathaway, Heathclose, Heathaway. It was a religious rave
with a cat strobe and muffled bass of mother’s voice. (I ran a fever of 105 that
day.)</li>
    <li>18. Bought myself a gigapet. A duck. Fed it for awhile. Gave it a bath.
Forgot about it for almost a couple months. One day, while cleaning, I found a
chain and he was there on the end. Hey, little duck. Mad freaky, hoppin’ around
with his hair out, squawking diagonal lines. In a tuxedo.</li>

<h2>3. If I Haven’t Treated You Like a Child Enough Already</h2>

<p>I’m proud of you. Anyone will tell you how much I brag about you. How I go on
and on about this great anonymous person out there who scrolls and reads and
scrolls and reads. “These kids,” I tell them. “Man, these kids got heart. I
never…” And I can’t even finish a sentence because I’m absolutely blubbering.</p>

<p>And my heart glows bright red under my filmy, translucent skin and they have to
administer 10cc of JavaScript to get me to come back. (I respond well to toxins
in the blood.) Man, that stuff will kick the peaches right out your gills!</p>

<p>So, yes. You’ve kept up nicely. But now I must begin to be a brutal
schoolmaster. I need to start seeing good marks from you. So far, you’ve done
nothing but move your eyes around a lot. Okay, sure, you did some exceptional
reading aloud earlier. Now we need some comprehension skills here, Smotchkkiss.</p>

<p><strong>Say aloud each of the parts of speech used below.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">times</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Odelay!"</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You might want to even cover this paragraph up while you read, because your eyes
might want to sneak to the answer. We have a <em>number</em> <code>5</code>, followed by a
<em>method</em> <code>.times</code>. Then, the first crab pincers of a <em>block</em>. The kernel
<em>method</em> <code>print</code> has no dot and is followed by a <em>string</em> <code>"Odelay!"</code>. The final
crab pincers close our <em>block</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Say aloud each of the parts of speech used below.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="s2">"restaurant"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">include?</span> <span class="s2">"aura"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Like the <code>print</code> method, <code>exit</code> is a kernel <em>method</em>. If you were paying
attention during the big list of keywords, you’ll know that <code>unless</code> is just
such a <em>keyword</em>. The <em>string</em> <code>"restaurant"</code> is clung to by the <em>method</em>
<code>include?</code>. And finally, the string <code>"aura"</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Say aloud each of the parts of speech used below.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'toast'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'cheese'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'wine'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">food</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">food</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">capitalize</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This caterpillar partakes of finer delicacies. An <em>array</em> starts this example.
In the array, three <em>strings</em> <code>'toast'</code>, <code>'cheese'</code>, and <code>'wine'</code>. The whole
array is trailed by a <em>method</em> <code>each</code>.</p>

<p>Inside of a <em>block</em>, the <em>block argument</em> <code>food</code>, traveling down its little
waterslide into the block. The <em>method</em> <code>capitalize</code> then capitalizes the first
letter of the block argument, which has become <em>variable</em> <code>food</code>. This
capitalized <em>string</em> is passed to kernel <em>method</em> <code>print</code>.</p>

<p>Look over these examples once again. Be sure you recognize the parts of speech
used. They each have a distinct look, don’t they? Take a deep breath, press
firmly on your temples. Now, let’s dissect a cow’s eye worth of code.</p>

<h2>4. An Example to Help You Grow Up</h2>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-7.png" alt="Gettin' cabin fever." title="Gettin' cabin fever." /></p>

<p><strong>Say aloud each of the parts of speech used below.</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'net/http'</span>
<span class="no">Net</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">HTTP</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">start</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'www.ruby-lang.org'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">80</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'/en/about/license.txt'</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">body</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first line is a method call. The <em>method</em> called <code>require</code> is used. A
<em>string</em> is passed to the method containing <code>'net/http'</code>. Think of this first
line of code as a sentence. We have told Ruby to load some helper code, the
<code>Net::HTTP</code> library.</p>

<p>The next three lines all go together. The <em>constant</em> <code>Net::HTTP</code> refers to the
library we loaded above. We are using the <em>method</em> <code>start</code> from the library.
Into the method, we’re sending a <em>string</em> <code>'www.ruby-lang.org'</code> and the <em>number</em>
<code>80</code>.</p>

<p>The word <code>do</code> opens a <em>block</em>. The block has one <em>block variable</em> <code>http</code>. Inside
the block, the <em>method</em> <code>print</code> is called. What is being printed?</p>

<p>From the <em>variable</em> <code>http</code>, the <em>method</em> <code>get</code> is called. Into <code>get</code>, we pass a
<em>string</em> containing the path <code>'/en/about/license.txt'</code>. Now, notice that another
method is chained onto <code>get</code>. The <em>method</em> <code>body</code>. Then, the block closes with
<code>end</code>.</p>

<p>Doing okay? Just out of curiosity, can you guess what this example does?
Hopefully, you’re seeing some patterns in Ruby. If not, just shake your head
vigorously while you’ve got these examples in your mind. The code should break
apart into manageable pieces.</p>

<p>For example, this pattern is used a number of times:</p>

<pre><code>_variable_ . _method_ ( _method arguments_ )
</code></pre>

<p>You see it inside the block:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'/en/about/license.txt'</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’re using Ruby to get a web page. You’ve probably used <span class="caps">HTTP</span> with your web browser. <span class="caps">HTTP</span>
is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. <span class="caps">HTTP</span> is used to
transfer web pages across the Internet. Conceptualize a bus driver that can
drive across the Internet and bring back web pages for us. On his hat are
stitched the letters <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.</p>

<p>The variable <code>http</code> is that bus driver. The <em>method</em> is a message to the bus
driver. Go <code>get</code> the web page called <code>/en/about/license.txt</code>.</p>

<p>So where you see the chain of methods:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'/en/about/license.txt'</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">body</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Since we’ll be getting back a web page from the <code>http</code> bus driver, you can read
this in your brain as:</p>

<pre><code>_web page_ .body
</code></pre>

<p>And this bit of code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-rb" data-lang="rb"><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'/en/about/license.txt'</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">body</span> <span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This code gets the web page. We send a <code>body</code> message to the web page, which
gives us all the <span class="caps">HTML</span> in a <em>string</em>. We then <code>print</code>
that string. See how the basic dot-method pattern happens in a chain. The next
chapter will explore all these sorts of patterns in Ruby. It’ll be good fun.</p>

<p>So, what does this code do? It prints the Ruby license page to the screen using
a web-enabled bus driver.</p>

<h2>5. And So, The Quick Trip Came To An Eased, Cushioned Halt</h2>

<p><img src="../images/the.foxes-8.png" alt="Running after the truck." title="Running after the
truck." /></p>

<p>So now we have a problem. I get the feeling that you are enjoying this way too
much. And you haven’t even hit the chapter where I use jump-roping songs to help
you learn how to parse <span class="caps">XML</span>!</p>

<p>If you’re already enjoying this, then things are really going bad. Two chapters
from now you’ll be writing your own Ruby programs. In fact, it’s right about
there that I’ll have you start writing your own role-playing game, your own
file-sharing network (a la BitTorrent), as well as a program that will pull
genuine random numbers from the Internet.</p>

<p style="float:right">
  <img src="../images/graph-1.gif" title="Proof has been extracted from the pudding." alt="Proof has been extracted from the pudding." />
</p>

<p>And you know (you’ve got to know!) that this is going to turn into an obsession.
First, you’ll completely forget to take the dog out. It’ll be standing by the
screen door, darting its head about, as your eyes devour the code, as your
fingers slip messages to the computer.</p>

<p>Thanks to your neglect, things will start to break. Your mounds of printed
sheets of code will cover up your air vents. Your furnace will choke. The trash
will pile-up: take-out boxes you hurriedly ordered in, junk mail you couldn’t
care to dispose of. Your own uncleanliness will pollute the air. Moss will
infest the rafters, the water will clog, animals will let themselves in, trees
will come up through the foundations.</p>

<p>But your computer will be well-cared for. And you, Smotchkkiss, will have
nourished it with your knowledge. In the eons you will have spent with your
machine, you will have become part-CPU. And it will have become part-flesh. Your
arms will flow directly into its ports. Your eyes will accept the video directly
from <span class="caps">DVI</span>-24 pin. Your lungs will sit just above the
processor, cooling it.</p>

<p>And just as the room is ready to force itself shut upon you, just as all the
overgrowth swallows you and your machine, you will finish your script. You and
the machine together will run this latest Ruby script, the product of your
obsession. And the script will fire up chainsaws to trim the trees, hearths to
warm and regulate the house. Builder nanites will rush from your script,
reconstructing your quarters, retiling, renovating, chroming, polishing,
disinfecting. Mighty androids will force your crumbling house into firm, rigid
architecture. Great pillars will rise, statues chiseled. You will have dominion
over this palatial estate and over the encompassing mountains and islands of
your stronghold.</p>

<p>So I guess you’re going to be okay. Whatdya say? Let’s get moving on this script
of yours?</p>
