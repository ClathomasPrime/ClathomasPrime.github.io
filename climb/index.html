          Before and after EC2019, I explored the climbing in Northern Arizona
          some. I wrote up a trip report <a href="nor-az-2019.html">here</a>,
          which even includes some helpful discussion and explanations of how climbing
          works.

          Before starting grad school, I took a gap semester to go on a
          cross-country rock climbing road trip. I made an 
          <a href="ramble-graphic.html">infographic</a> attempting
          to show my progress and some of the highs and lows.
