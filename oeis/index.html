  </cite>
  <div class="description">
    This sequence is the best known lower bound on the maximum number of
    stable matchings on n men and n women.
    An analysis of the growth of this sequence was known, but never published.
    With some help from Peter Shor this analysis is finally
    available <a href="https://oeis.org/A005154/a005154.pdf">here</a>.

    <a href="https://oeis.org/A116078">A116078</a>. Number of antichains in a
      cylinder poset.
  </cite>
  <div class="description">
    One way to prove upper bounds on the worst-case maximum number of stable 
    marriages is to prove upper bounds on the number of antichains in
    "tangled \(n \times n\) grid" posets, as observed by
    <a href="https://users.renyi.hu/~emlektab/emlektabla8problems.pdf#page=20">Dömötör
    Pálvölgyi</a>.
    There is a simple tangled grid poset whose number of antichains is exactly
    A116078, as we show <a href="https://oeis.org/A116078/a116078.pdf">here</a>.
    This sequence grows like \( \sqrt{n} 4^n \).
    This by itself disproves Pálvölgyi's conjecture that tangled \(n \times n\) grids have
    at most \(4^n\) antichains, and a modification of the analysis I gave
    for A005154 <a href="https://oeis.org/A005154/a005154.pdf">here</a>
    actually proves that tangled grids can have
    up to \( 4.17^n \) antichains.

    A lot of interesting combinatorial questions arise from investigating sets
    of linear orders over which majority voting never produces cycles.
