  <h2><span>Dominoes on chess boards</span></h2>

  <p>
    In class, we proved that it's impossible to cover a checkerboard
    with opposite corners removed using 2 by 1 dominoes.
    The reason is that all those dominoes cover exactly one black
    and exactly one white square, but the board we are given
    has a different number of black and white squares.
  </p>
  <p>
    Call a subset S of a checkerboard <em> balanced </em> if it has
    the same number of black and white squares.
    Can every balanced, connected subset of a chess board be tiled by dominoes?
  </p>
